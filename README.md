## Overview
One of my very first web designs, implemented simply with HTML and CSS. This was an experiment in broadening my design perspective that proved to be pretty fun the more that I contributed to it. My designs previously were a bit more indulgent in a narrower scope, so to simply try a different, lighter, "cuter" design was a great challenge for a noive web developer. 

## Client
The client in this scenario is the owners of this imagined business. The business is a local ice cream shop, with an audience aimed toward a younger crowd, to give the brand and reputation a fun, lively impression. The aim of the aesthetic is to balance a universal appeal with a slightly more feminine design.

## Personal Project Takeaways
Before this project, I started taking interest in CSS frameworks because the concept broadened many of my understandings of CSS. I was testing out a popular framework called [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). This project helped me hone in on my preferences with CSS frameworks and methodologies, which eventually led me to create my own CSS Framework, [Forten](https://github.com/KyleFontenot/Forten).
